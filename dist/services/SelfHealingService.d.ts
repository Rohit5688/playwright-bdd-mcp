/**
 * SelfHealingService
 *
 * Architecture: The service is purely a "classifier and prompt builder".
 * It does NOT modify any files itself. Instead, it analyses the terminal failure
 * output returned by TestRunnerService, classifies the root-cause, and returns a
 * rich instruction block that lets the Client LLM know EXACTLY what to fix.
 *
 * Classification Strategy:
 *   SCRIPTING_FAILURE  - Locator not found, timeout on element, TypeScript compile error
 *   APPLICATION_FAILURE - Assertion on value mismatch (e.g. wrong text, wrong URL)
 *   UNKNOWN            - Anything else (network, auth, flaky infra)
